## Frontend coding challenge

You'll be building a simple react component: an avatar picker. It looks like this:

![Pick an avatar](https://github.com/JoinColony/coding-challenge/raw/master/avatar_picker.gif "Pick me!")

The user clicks on the avatar to open a popover which allows the user to choose another avatar from the list. After a click a (fake) HTTP request is made (while a loading spinner runs), the popover closes and the new avatar will appear in the initial view.

### Instructions:

Our front-end coding challenge should provide you with the opportunity to demonstrate your JavaScript skills, as well as some capabilities with UI layout and functionality.

Depending upon whether you are already comfortable with React, it will also allow you to demonstrate either your level of mastery, or, your ability to pick up the basics of something new. Your starting level of familiarity will be taken into consideration.

You may make use of any additional technologies you feel are appropriate but React is required.

### Requirements:

* Requested browser compatibility: IE11 and up, current versions of Chrome, FF, Safari.
* The project must be in a git repository as you will demonstrate your ability to work with version control.
* Follow the design as precisely as you can. A designer will validate the end result and functionality.
* You may split up the main component in as many sub-components as you see fit and necessary.
* The whole component must also be fully usable when just using a keyboard.
* Think of it as a component that will end up in a large, scalable react app. Consider this when writing HTML and CSS as well.
* You're NOT allowed to use any third party CSS libraries.
* You're free to use any build tools that you like (including CSS pre/post-processors). Do not focus on the tooling though. Choose tools that get you going quickly (when you're unsure, [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/) might work well for you).
* Only use the image assets given in this repository and do not modify the files in any way.

### How to submit your results:

* The results have to be shared as a git repository
* You can either create a private repository on your favourite git hosting provider (github, gitlab, bitbucket) and then give access to
  * jacob.johansson@pickit.com
* Or create a public repository and send the link to it.
* Or send the whole repository, zipped (including the `.git` directory) to both of these email addresses.
* Important note: please only submit your work when it is completely done!

Happy coding and good luck! :heart:
